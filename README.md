# Mineverse
We all know that current metaverse games have an economy. 
But they are usually deflationary. At the same time, 
they do not support more people to join, and are friendly to those who join first.
Like Sandbox, we need Token to buy land, and lands that are well located usually have better value.
This should be called the meta-world rather than the meta-verse.
Eventually, it becomes a capitalist's game.

Minecraft and Roblox inspired me.
Minecraft is the second best-selling games in the world(The first is Tetris). 
Everyone can launch a minecraft server in a fraction of the time.
Everyone can enjoy the game all day.
Friends in the game are usually limited to one server.
We use the cross-server teleport command to tp another server.

We use MCTokens as tokens in the game, and MCTokens are accepted by all players and servers.
These tokens are used to incentivize server operators depending on the player activity on a particular server.

## Server Connection system
In testing
1. We can teleport from one server to another.
2. Inventory and status are not preserved.
3. Each player can retrieve a list of online servers.

## Economic system
Under development
1. Tokens are used to incentivize server operators.
2. Players can redeem it via blockchain.
3.
